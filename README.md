## Final assignment for Python course at CIMeC.

My idea for the final assignment consists of generating a Python script that automatize the scoring process 
of a neuropsychological test I am administering for my PhD project.

## Brief description of my project:
My PhD project aims at investigating, with a mixed-methods approach, the psychological side effects 
of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients.
This includes administering a questionnaire that assesses quality of life in patient with PD, the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39),
before and after DBS implantation.

## THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE (PDQ-39) STRUCTURE:

The PDQ-39 consists of 39 questions that assess various aspects of daily life impacted by Parkinson's disease. 

The questions are grouped into 8 different domains: Mobility (MOB; items 1-10), Activities of Daily Living (ADL; items 11-16) , Emotional Well-being (EMO; items 17-22), Stigma (STI; items 23-26), Social Support (SOC; items 27-29), Cognition (COG; items 30-33), Communication (COM; items 34-36), and Bodily Discomfort (BOD; items 37-39). 
Patients answer each question based on their experiences over the past month.

SCORING PROCESS OF PDQ-39: 

The eight PDQ‐39 scale scores are generated by Likert's method of summated ratings (ie, item responses are summed without weighting or standardisation).
Scores are then transformed to a common range of 0–100 (100 =  maximum level of problems).
Item scores can range between 0 and 4 (0 = never; 1 = seldom; 2 = sometimes; 3 = often; 4 = always).

> Domain scores:
To obtain the domain-specific score we need to perform the following calculations:
1 - Sum up the raw scores from each domain (scale)
2 - Divide this number by the maximum score for each question (4)
3 - Divide the result by the total number of questions for each domain 
4 - Multiply the last result for 100

> Summary index score:
To obtain the summary index score, average the domain scores. Sum up the domain scores and divide the total by the number of domains (8 in the case of the PDQ-39). 
The summary index score represents the overall impact of Parkinson's disease on the person's quality of life.
